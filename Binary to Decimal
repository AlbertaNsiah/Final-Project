#**_Binary to Decimal conversion_**
##Dealing with binary to decimal conversions here are some things to take note of :
_Each of the digits can only be a 1 or a 0_
_start with the number on the right because it makes the process easier_

###**Example 1**

####**Let's begin with a random binary number**
110100
**STEP 1**
Starting from  the number on the far right which is _0_ we're going to start numbering the digits and everytime you move to your left you're going to double the digits.
1  1  0 1 0 0
32 16 8 4 2 1
**Step 2**
We're going to add up the numbers everywhere you see a 1.
The numbers in this example will be _4,16,32
**Step 3**
Add up the numbers
4 + 16 + 32 = **_52_**


#####**Example 2**
101101
**STEP 1**
Number the digits and double it everytime you move to your left
1  0  1 1 0 1
32 16 8 4 2 1
**STEP 2**
Add up the numbers everywhere you see a 1.
That will be _1,4,8,32_
**Answer** : 1+$+*+32 = **_45_**
